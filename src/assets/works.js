export const opPara = `The term cosmos is defined as "the universe seen as a well-ordered whole" (Oxford Dictionary). To me, writing is the same. Different writings are like the various elements of the universe, but together they represent my writing style, creating my own writing cosmos. There is an order to the elements in the cosmos, and I believe my writing reflects a similar order. Initially, I focused on small elements in my writing rather than seeing it as a whole. However, I changed this approach, striving to convey a larger message across my pieces instead of perfecting one paragraph while neglecting others. As I continue writing, I hope to keep building my cosmos, allowing my work to be represented as a cohesive whole.`;


export const exPara = `In my ‘Writing Cosmos’ you will come across various artifacts of my work. These will explain my writing process and development. These artifacts show how I developed each element of the Cosmos and as you explore the cosmos further you will start to see the connection between the pieces. By the end of your journey I hope you are able to understand my writing as a whole rather than just some pieces of work.`;


export const moonOpening = `A moon is a small yet significant supporting figure in the cosmos. It can illuminate a planet during the night and serve as a guide. Similarly, my reader responses act as guiding figures, helping me craft successful works. They provide me with a deeper understanding of the topic at hand and allow me to develop my thoughts before beginning the actual writing process.`;

export const moonMR1 = `When writing my very first reader response—a response to the article "Shitty First Drafts" by Anne Lamott—I was very direct in answering the questions rather than elaborating on the ideas. At the beginning of the paper, I ensured it included an MLA header, as I was taught in high school. However, the paper quickly diverged from MLA format, as I wrote single-spaced paragraphs. Although the assignment did not specifically require MLA format, I chose to use it because I felt it would make my work appear more professional.

My writing style in this piece was very analytical. I began with the statement: “The main point of Lamott's article is the idea of not being afraid to just start writing.” This analytical tone remained consistent throughout my reader responses as I aimed to stay objective while addressing the questions. Lamott’s writing significantly influenced my drafts of Major Project 1: Portrait of a Writer. As I mentioned earlier, I tried to remain “rhetorically analytical,” framing my writing to engage with Lamott’s ideas. For example, I wrote: “As a credible writer herself, sharing these experiences makes me understand these doubts are normal, and I must be terrible first to be perfect later.” In this sentence, I interpret Lamott’s message and present it in an informative tone. This mini-analysis of my various reader responses became a guide for understanding and developing my writing later on.`


export const moonMR2 = `Similar to my Major Project 1 reader responses, I maintained an analytical tone throughout my subsequent responses. For example, when reviewing my reader response to Wardle, it becomes immediately clear how my writing had evolved. After completing Major Project 1, I had a better grasp of MLA format, which I applied consistently in my later academic writings. I used the same analytical tone in Wardle’s reader response as I did in Lamott’s. However, I incorporated much more evidence in this response compared to my earlier ones, demonstrating a noticeable improvement in my writing. This allowed me to be even more objective, enabling me to extract more valuable insights, which I later integrated into Major Project 2.

export const planetOP = `The planets are the main elements of the cosmos. They are guided by the moon that orbits around them. To me, my major projects are the planets of my cosmos. They are the central elements of ENC 1102 and the biggest indicators of my writing and growth. The major projects have allowed me to solidify my writing and develop a unique style that can be seen, which I hope represents my cosmos.

`;

export const planetMR11 = `The first major project, "Portrait of a Writer," explored my previous journey and growth as a writer. Coming into this project after reading and responding to Lamont, I was able to dive straight in, hoping to write whatever I could and adjust it later. My first draft, although not completely finished, had the basic idea of what I was aiming for. I started with a metaphor of "ego" that I was using to scale my writing as it developed. I planned to use anecdotes for these comparisons. In the body paragraph of my first draft, it is clear that I was very focused on using a narrative-like structure to write my essay. Although this style suited the project well, I was not very analytical about my writing. I used anecdotes to describe my writing but never went in-depth about them. I also relied heavily on metaphors, which made my writing confusing rather than purposeful. For example, "At the same time, I had also summoned a ghost that would haunt me, and that was the everlasting boredom born from the mundane — a product of my ego." Although my goal was to have a metaphor I could use for comparison, I failed to present my ideas clearly. This was pointed out during the peer review, where comments highlighted that although the text was engaging, it was confusing and lacked a clear direction.`

export const planetMR12 = `Going into my final draft, I kept my introductory paragraph the same. From the peer review, I had learned that my introduction was a great hook for my essay, so I decided to stick with the metaphorical approach and keep it unchanged. However, I made significant changes to the body paragraphs. Although I started off with anecdotes once again, after finishing each story, I would move on to analyze my writing at that stage of my life. I would then compare my writing with the metaphor I had created, which helped create a sense of progress that the reader could easily follow. The best way I found to analyze my stories was through citations from Lamont, which I used to review my writing. I was able to relate my doubts to Lamont’s expression of fear that writers face. I also learned from Dr. Tanemura’s feedback on the narrative element, which made the essay very engaging to read. I plan to use such elements in my future writing, whether academic or for other works, as I continue to develop a clear sense of style. Overall, from my first draft, I was able to create a clear picture of both my narrative and the analysis in my "Portrait of a Writer" essay.`;

export const MR21 = `Major project two, "Introduction to My Discourse Community," was about exploring and explaining why a community is a discourse community. Before ENC1102, I had never heard of this term, so the first challenge for me was to understand it. However, through reading about Swales and the reader response, I was able to formulate my thoughts on the idea. For this piece, I chose to write about a club I am a part of called "AI UCF," and I explained in detail the reasons I believe it is a discourse community. For the first draft of this piece, I chose to approach it from a narrative angle once again. But as I wrote, I soon realized this approach was not suitable for this paper. I was wasting my writing on unnecessary anecdotes, which became apparent even to me. It became clearer from the feedback in my peer reviews, where the reader was confused by the points I was trying to make, as my writing spiraled into a stream of confusion.`;

export const MR22 = `Similar to my ‘Portrait of a Writer’ essay, I again chose to use a metaphor, as soon and explained in the introduction as , ‘The Light at the End of the Tunnel’, to explain my discourse community. This metaphorical pattern is seen throughout both of my major projects as I find using such metaphors to explain and analyze to be rhetorically satisfying. But this project differed vastly from my first major project. Although I used narration in various parts of this essay, they were mostly to be an assistant to explain my points. I conveyed this essay very analytically as I found it to be fitting the style of proving why and how my community is a discourse community. I also used a large amount of citations from Swales during this essay simply because I was connecting his ideas to a discourse community to my explanations. Overall this essay allowed me to be very analytical which I hope to use in my future writings when it comes to an argument/persuasive piece.

export const starsIntro = `Stars are elements in the cosmos that can be seen from anywhere. They are among the largest objects, as even planets can be seen revolving around them. In my writing cosmos, stars represent the learning that my planets and moons— the major projects and reader responses— demonstrate. Stars serve as the overall reflection and learning outcomes for me in ENC 1102.`;

export const outCome1 = `"Generating Inquiry" simply refers to my ability to formulate critical ideas, questions, and meanings throughout my writing. The best example of this, I believe, is my major project one, "Portrait of a Writer." From the beginning, I formulate the idea of the "ego of a writer," which I reference throughout my essay. This demonstrates my ability to generate meaningful ideas that contribute to and explain my choices. It shows my capacity to independently develop writing that is meaningful to me and clear to others, helping them understand what I am writing about.`;

export const outCome2 = `"Multiple Ways of Writing" is the idea that I am able to formulate my ideas in various ways, rather than relying on just one. This is evident in my comparison of major project one and major project two. Major project one heavily relied on narratives to convey my point, while major project two focused on source analysis, along with meaningful explanations from citations. This demonstrates the different writing styles I have used throughout the course, showing that I have met this outcome.`;

export const outCome3 = `"Information Literacy" is my ability to reliably and ethically use sources. This is most evident in my major project two piece. I am able to bring in external sources, such as the AI UCF constitution and an article about machine learning from IBM, to effectively cite and relate to my topic. This demonstrates my ability to understand what kinds of sources I need to use and my capability to incorporate them effectively.`;

export const outCome4 = `"Research Genre Production" refers to my use of various research formats, styles, and conventions appropriate for the type of writing. This is most evident in major project two, where I used MLA format, as shown by the header and works cited page. I also maintained a formal tone, as the project required a high level of analysis. Additionally, I used various sources for my research and synthesized the information to demonstrate that AI UCF is a discourse community.`;

export const outCome5 = `"Contributing Knowledge" refers to my ability to produce original knowledge that is applicable to the real world. I demonstrate this through major project one, where I use the metaphor of "ego" to present original ideas. I also incorporate Lamont’s concepts and connect them to my writing, showing my ability to use research to generate new knowledge. During the peer review process, I demonstrated my ability to collaborate and receive feedback. Lastly, I was able to understand my writing and determine when to use narrative-based approaches in that project.`;

export const outCome6 = `"Revision" refers to my ability for critical self-reflection. I have demonstrated this throughout my ePortfolio by showing where I fell short in multiple projects, how I recognized these shortcomings, and how I overcame such hurdles.`;


export const finalReflection = `ENC 1102 has been a class focused on self-reflection. From starting with understanding my writing to exploring my community, the class has allowed me to reflect on my writing journey throughout. It exposed me to a wealth of information about various types of writing, styles, and understanding. I have developed an understanding of style conventions for different literary texts, particularly the narrative and analytical approaches, which will be useful in my future writing depending on the rhetorical situation (for example, using an analytical style when sending an email). As I move forward, I hope to encounter various kinds of writing where I can apply these styles.`;

export const majorProj3RR = `I approached Major Project 3 reader response much more differently than my other two. Major project 3 entailed writing a rhetorical analysis from a previous project. So it required me to grasp many concepts regarding this subject. For Major project 3 I was required to do a reader response on Doug Down and Grant-Davie, but I will focus on Doug Downs more as I believe his text helped me the most.  I do so in my reader response by discussing my previous knowledge of rhetoric as done in the beginning paragraphs before conceptualizing terms such as ‘Rhetorical Ecology’ in my response. I grasp these topics which prove to be later useful in my major project 3 when I discuss the exigence and purpose of my writing and such. It is also evident that I am looking to understand multiple concepts in this reader response than just one concept as I did with my previous responses as I want to understand these topics for using them in my own writing.`;

export const MJ31 =` For Major Project 3, which was a letter to a future student while analyzing my past major projects,  I was a bit confused on how I wanted to start and frankly I rushed through it. This is evident when looking at my organization of the letter. It is all over the place.  I start with a very ambiguous beginning failing to state the learning outcomes I want to discuss. Then I go into discussing my previous major projects which I again do so horribly. I state what the major projects are and give evidence but fail to actually expand on these evidence. They are left as pieces of information with no connection between them. Further I also fail to actually explain how my evidence for every major project actually connects to my learning outcome. I failed to utilize what I grasped from my reader response and wanted to change that in my final draft.
`;

export const MJ32 = ` From Dr. Tanemura’s feedback I was able to heavily improve my project. The first thing was the organization. It now flowed perfectly where I mention the two learning outcomes I hoped to discuss in the first paragraph before jumping straight into discussing them. I briefly introduced each major project before providing evidence from them and finally elaborating on how the evidence connected directly with the learning outcomes. This heavily improved the organization of my letter and made it much easier to read and understand. I also managed to elaborate much further on the evidence I provided showing my learning outcomes which really highlighted the materials I grasped from the reader responses.
